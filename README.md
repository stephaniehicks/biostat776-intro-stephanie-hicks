## About me 

Hello! I'm an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at JHSPH and Faculty Member in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab. 

## Three fun facts about me 

1. I love to bake anything and everything. I used to love to make breads, but these days I find myself making cookies or muffins most often! 
2. I have three kids (all boys). The oldest is starting 1st grade this fall -- eep! 
3. I am involved with the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) community -- think of it like a cousin to CRAN, but for high-throughput biological data.
